# giphy-search
A simple webapp to search for and save gifs. 

Modelled after Instagram and making heavy use of the [GIPHY React SDK](https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-js), this app requires a ``Google OAuth`` signin but only stores the user's profile name in ``localStorage``. Credentials are not stored, and there is no backend attached to this app.
